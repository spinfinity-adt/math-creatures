MathCreature_Refuge_1,Maria,Refuge,6th,F,"This one is from the Refuge group. This is the only mildly positive drawing. She’s drawn a cute little girl and written, “you are very interesting.” She’s visualized her math person as a girl made of shapes. You can see triangles and other elements of math, very mildly.","Neutral, mildly positive",made of shapes,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinfinity-adt/math-creatures/main/trimmed/MathCreature_Refuge_1.png
MathCreature_Refuge_2,Maths Man,Refuge,9th,F,"She starts by writing an acronym for math: “Mental Attack to Hyper students.” Then she says, “I’m not gonna let you go away from me.” Her math human has shapes built into the body, (a triangle for a nose, pencils for hands, and squares for eyes), so you can see mathematical forms in how she’s drawn the person. Next to it, she’s written, “you actually look great and cute,” and she’s named the character Maths Man.","Aggressive, threatening, anger",made of shapes,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinfinity-adt/math-creatures/main/trimmed/MathCreature_Refuge_2.png
MathCreature_Refuge_3,Itachi,Refuge,10th,F,"This math person is called Itachi. At the top, she’s written, “this is Itachi.” The math person is made up of shapes: a triangular cone for a hat, a face drawn with this emoji :-|, circles for feet, and rectangles for the rest of the body. You can see shapes being used to represent the math person.

The conversation is very aggressive. It says, “Why the hell did you find math, Itachi?” Then, “Is it too much that you found math? No one likes math, Itachi.” She also asks, “Is your home built with numbers, Itachi?” At the end, she writes, “My mood just goes off because of you, Itachi, because of this math.”","aggressive, mood off, existential",made of shapes,Why the hell did you find math? | Is your home built with numbers?,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinfinity-adt/math-creatures/main/trimmed/MathCreature_Refuge_3.png
MathCreature_Refuge_4,,Refuge,1st Year B.A. Psych,F,"This one is written by a volunteer, a second-year college student. She writes, “Dear Math, I’ve despised you all my school life. However, having lived the next couple of years without you in my syllabus, I’ve come to miss you. I appreciate your presence and will try to understand you more. Geometry, physics, accounts, you poke your nose everywhere. Do that a little less, nosy neighbor.” She also adds, “I hope the world gets to explore you throughout and never forget any concept we learned."", and ends with  ""I felt dumb because of you!”

Her math person looks a bit like a Joker character, with a hat made of a triangle, cube, and sphere. The character is saying, “Is math a joke to you?!”","empathy, humiliation","made of shapes, joker",,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinfinity-adt/math-creatures/main/trimmed/MathCreature_Refuge_4.png

MathCreature_Refuge_7,numb,Refuge,8th,F,"This math person is called Numb, because numbers make her feel numb. She’s used 1s for the hair, squares with dots inside for the eyes, and a triangle for the nose. Numb’s shirt is covered in numbers: 1 to 16 across the shirt, 17 and 18 as the collar, and the pants filled with numbers—19 to 33 on one leg and 34 to 50 on the other.

She’s also drawn herself next to Numb and named herself Jasmine. Above Jasmine’s head are multiplication tables, and her face looks sad and confused

Jasmine is asking Numb a series of questions: “Who are you? Why are you created? Why did they keep your name as Maths? In the world, many students hate you. Do you have feelings? Do you cry?

MathCreature_RGH_1,Chota Bheem,RGH,4th,M,"Asif imagines math as Chota Bheem. He’s drawn Chota Bheem holding a bag of laddus, which is Chota Bheem’s signature thing. There’s also something on the side that looks like a launcher, which Asif seems to imagine as a way to launch the laddus at his students.

Asif has written a note next to the drawing that says, “Bheem is putting glass because he’s math’s teacher.” Through this, Asif is showing that the way he has added a math teacher persona to Chota Bheem is by giving him glasses.",,,,
MathCreature_RGH_2,Joker,RGH,4th,,"The next math creature is called Joker. There is a clown who is juggling balls, or objects that look like balls. The balls have motion trails behind them, showing the movement of juggling.",,,,
MathCreature_RGH_3,Asim's Math tree,RGH,4th,M,"This child has drawn a math tree. In the leaves of the tree, there are symbols like plus signs, multiplication signs, division signs, minus signs, and a 1. These symbols are arranged to form a triangular pattern that sits within the branches.

The top row has six plus signs, with the last one rotated into a multiplication sign. Below that are three multiplication signs, then three minus signs, then three division signs, and finally a 1 at the bottom.

The tree trunk has a smiling face and two separate hands with leaves, making it look like a stick-figure-style humanoid tree.",,,,
MathCreature_RGH_4,Math Apple,RGH,4th,M,"The next child has drawn a math apple. The apple has two square eyes with dots in the middle and the word “math” written below them. Around the apple, there are multiplication signs on the left and right, and division signs near the top, close to the stem. At the base of the apple, there is some negative space, and there are plus and minus signs there, with the words “area” and “perimeter” written just below them.

The apple has a smiling mouth, and its teeth are showing. Below the drawing, the child has written ""He is boy, he is a smart person and the math is taking a class. and I gone listen and the apple math is crying because I ate math apple half. It is so sad and the student is laughing"" So the negative space at the base of the apple represents the half that has been eaten.",,,,
MathCreature_RGH_5,Harshita's Math Tree,RGH,4th,F,"Harshita’s math tree. It starts off like a normal tree, with a trunk, two main branches, and leaves surrounding the branches. Instead of fruits, the leaves contain symbols and numbers: a couple of plus signs, numbers like 50, 100, 1, 2, and 25, along with division signs. One of the division signs is slightly rotated, looking like a modulus sign, which is likely a coincidence.

On the trunk of the tree, there is an evil smiling face. The expression looks evil because of the eyebrows and the shape of the mouth. Below the leaves, there are two additional branches that act like hands reaching outward, almost as if the tree is coming to get you.",,,,
