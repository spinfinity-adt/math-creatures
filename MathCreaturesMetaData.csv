Next to it, she’s written, “you actually look great and cute,” and she’s named the character Maths Man.","Aggressive, threatening, anger",made of shapes,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinfinity-adt/math-creatures/main/trimmed/MathCreature_Refuge_2.png
MathCreature_Refuge_3,Itachi,Refuge,10th,F,"This math person is called Itachi. At the top, she’s written, “this is Itachi.” The math person is made up of shapes: a triangular cone for a hat, a face drawn with this emoji :-|, circles for feet, and rectangles for the rest of the body. You can see shapes being used to represent the math person.

The conversation is very aggressive. It says, “Why the hell did you find math, Itachi?” Then, “Is it too much that you found math? No one likes math, Itachi.” She also asks, “Is your home built with numbers, Itachi?” At the end, she writes, “My mood just goes off because of you, Itachi, because of this math.”","aggressive, mood off, existential",made of shapes,Why the hell did you find math? | Is your home built with numbers?,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinfinity-adt/math-creatures/main/trimmed/MathCreature_Refuge_3.png

Geometry, physics, accounts, you poke your nose everywhere. Do that a little less, nosy neighbor.” She also adds, “I hope the world gets to explore you throughout and never forget any concept we learned."", and ends with  ""I felt dumb because of you!”
